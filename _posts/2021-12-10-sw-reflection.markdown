### SW Reflection!

I think that the most valuable skill is communication. This entire project was about
making sure that our clients were happy, not ourselves. We needed the ability to understand
what they wanted in their final product and the ability to communicate our limitations given
the limited amount of time we had. Although we have not completely finished our project to the
extent that we would like, our client seemed happy with the progress which made us feel happy
ourselves.

I think that the social change employed by our community partner was not particularlyl effective in
changing my social needs. I will admit that it is nice to be able to work on a project as a group, but
I feel as if it hardly impacted me socially, envoirnmentally, or spiritually

One of my fundamental/social values is to make who im working for happy every step of the way. It makes
me happy to make other people happy. And when other people arn't happy its going to be bad times for both
of you. Going through this course confirmed that becuase when our client said that he was happy with the
progress it made me happy and want to work harder as a result. I do not believe that any experience in class
has challenged this idea.

This project has caused me to understand that there are many people who are doing good things in the world. And
something as simple as creating a website for them could allow them to help many many more people. It has made me
realize how powerful computer science is in these community driven services.
