### Data Modeling!

Assumptions that I made for this was that there was one owner. That owner listed items for sell.
The owner could or could not list many items. Customers when on the website then could or could not
have one or more orders. Those orders had to contain one or more items in them. What I regret about
the project is that I believe I chose the wrong graph for this project becuase rather than FK's and PK's
I was only able to use M-Manditory and PI. I wanted customer Id to be a FK and all PI's to be PK's. I also
wanted my Item ID to be a PK FK.
