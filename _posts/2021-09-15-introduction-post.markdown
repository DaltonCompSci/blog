### Talk about a slow setup

This is my first Jekyll blog :D. Mostly everything was new to me except using Ubuntu.Luckily I have past experience with Ubuntu 
from Operating Systems. What was difficult was finding which order I needed to install things in. I ended up installing Jekyll
pieces early and in the wrong files so that took me a few minutes to figure out. Things im looking forwards to are:

*Using markdown which is easier than HTML

*Being able to use and edit my own blog

*Although unrelated start working on our final project

This blog is all possible thanks to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) , and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).
