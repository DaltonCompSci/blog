### Entity Framework!

The easiest parts of this tutorial were the last few parts. It was simple copy paste and did not
require much skill or thinking. The most confusing parts of the tutorial was the migrations as we
messed up a couple of times. What was difficult about working with multiple tables was that there is
a lot more overall to keep track of which also means more bugs. I think this lab has helped a lot in
understanding how our database can come together. For us, what is different is that we have one main database
that we have to work with rather than many, and that database can only be edited by people with the permission
to do so.
