### SO MANY BUGS

While doing this project I have had an enormous amount of bugs and issues that kept me from
progressing. From files not being where they needed to 404.html files replacing current ones,
there were a lot of problems that I had doing what should have taken me 20 minutes at most.
Things that were new to me were all the bugs I encountered and new markdown bits like image posting.


If you ever want to buy airsoft equipment I recommend [Airsoft Gi](https://www.airsoftgi.com/) , and [Evike](https://www.evike.com/).
