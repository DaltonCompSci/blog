### Razor Pages!

The easiest part of the tutorial was part 2. It was mostly copy and paste or follow
these easy steps that are hard to mess up. The hardest part of the tutorial was
the beggining setup, becuase as with most things, I attract bugs better than honey!
I decided on shows because not only are movies and shows similar but also becuase
that was simply the first thing that came to mind. Getting step 2 started took a little
time to complete as well since I was having trouble getting it started. I feel pretty
confident in making another Razor application now since I have seen and solved my fair
share of bugs. I swear I need to install a bug zapper onto my old laptop.
