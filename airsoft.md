  Airsoft is one of my favorite out door activities. I first got into Airsoft
  when I was 15 years old. Some of my friends liked playing and asked me to join
  them. So, I joined them using their equipment and fell in love with it.
  It was super fun to play a military sim in real life. After a while of using
  my friends equipment I finally got my own. I got a full Russian military outfit
  with a Maska-1 Sch helmet, and a AK-105 as an airsoft weapon.
